# test if class Solver exists
# test if class Solver has a method factorial
# test special case when the argument is 0 this method sould return 1
# test if argument is negative this method should return some warning
# test if argument is not an integer this method should return some warning
# test if argument is 3 this method should return 6 (3 * 2 * 1)
# test if argument is 9 this method should return 362880
# test if class Solver has a method reverse
# test if argument is a string, other way return some warning
# test if argument is "hello" this method should return "olleh"
# test if class Solver has a method fizzbuzz
# test if argument is not an integer this method should return some warning
# test if the returned value is a string
# test if argument is divisible by 3 this method should return "fizz"
# test if argument is 9 this method should return "fizz"
# test if argument is divisible by 5 this method should return "buzz"
# test if argument is 50 this method should return "buzz"
# test if argument is divisible by 3 and 5 this method shoudl return "fizzbuzz"
# test if argument is 15 this method should return "fizzbuzz"
# test if argument is not divisible by 3 or 5 this method should return the argument
# test if argument is 7 this method should return 7
