# TDD Project <a name="about-project"></a>

Welcome to the Test-Driven Development (TDD) project! In this project, you will implement a class with some methods, following the TDD approach. Remember that the idea is to write tests first and then the code. This will be verified in your commits history, so it is important to use the proper sequence.

## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

This project is built using the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD), which emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. You'll be using the TDD process to create and validate your class and its methods.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
To get started with the TDD project, follow these steps:

### Setup <a name="setup"></a>
1. Clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danifromecuador/TDD-Ruby.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd TDD-Ruby
   ```

### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>
- An integrated development environment (IDE) for writing Ruby code.
- Ruby installed on your machine.
- Git installed on your machine.
- A GitHub account for version control.

## 🔭 Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

While the primary focus of this project is to implement a class with methods using the TDD approach, there are several exciting possibilities for future enhancements:

- [ ] **Additional Methods**: Expand the class by adding more methods that perform various tasks relevant to the class's purpose.

- [ ] **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to ensure the class handles unexpected situations gracefully.

- [ ] **Optimizations**: Optimize the code for performance and efficiency, especially if dealing with large datasets.

- [ ] **Documentation**: Enhance the documentation for the class, including inline comments and detailed usage examples.

- [ ] **Testing Suites**: Create a comprehensive suite of tests that cover various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the class's reliability.

- [ ] **Integration with Other Libraries**: Explore possibilities for integrating the class with other libraries or services to extend its functionality.

- [ ] **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the class, making it more accessible to users who may not be familiar with coding.

- [ ] **Data Storage**: Implement data storage and retrieval mechanisms, such as databases or file storage, to persist data across sessions.

## ❓ FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

*Q: What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)?*
A: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where you write tests before writing the actual code. It helps ensure that your code meets the requirements and works correctly. In this project, you will practice TDD by writing tests first and then implementing the code to make those tests pass.

*Q: How do I get started with TDD in this project?*
A: To get started with TDD in this project, follow the setup instructions provided in this README. Once you have the project set up, you can begin by writing tests for the class and methods you need to implement. After writing the tests, write the code to make those tests pass.

*Q: Can I add more features to the class as I progress?*
A: Yes, you can certainly add more features or expand the functionality of the class as you progress with the project. It's a good practice to start with a basic set of requirements and then build upon it as needed.
